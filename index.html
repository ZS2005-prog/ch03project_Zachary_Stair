        <img id="tree_png" src="media/tree.png" alt="A png of a simple tree that you would find in a forest"/>
        <img id="tree_jpg" src="media/tree.jpg" alt="A jpg of a tree that could be found somewhere in a forest or park"/>
        <p>
            The differences in the file size for these trees is massive. First the png image has a file size of 6,452 kb meanwhile the jpg file has less kbs with the file containing 1,637 kb. This shows how a jpg format is a lot more efficent than the png format. However, as for visual differences I couldn't find any becuse both images are the same and the only difference is that they are in two different image formats.
